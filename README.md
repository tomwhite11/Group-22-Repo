# Group-22-Repo

the code mostly uses pandas data frames.

to run python notebooks you will need to extract the data from the callout dataset teams group using a 3rd part extractor such as 7zip or winrar. you will also need to change the file directory at the beginning of the notebook to match your own. the code currently only uses the data from july of 2022 but will be expanded soon. upon running the each note book a .pkl file will be created.

the easiest way to write code to process the data is to download or create a .pkl file, there is an example of this in the repository
